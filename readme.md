# Docker Data Science Stack

A Simple and Lightweight Docker Python Data Science Setup

Here's a simple docker setup I put together to spin up two docker containers
with Postgres on one, and Python and Jupyter lab on another. The Notebook will
write data to the database and later read the data from the database.

This file will soon include more instructions on how to run the docker
containers and get your environment working.

## TODOs:
- [ ] Add setup and running steps here.
